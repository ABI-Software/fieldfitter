*fieldfitter library*
=====================

The *fieldfitter library* fits continuous fields over a scaffold to discrete, non-geometric data, e.g. physiological measurements at points over the domain of the scaffold. Model representation and fitting is performed with the underlying *OpenCMISS-Zinc library*.

Most users will use this from the ABI Mapping Tools' **Field Fitter** user interface for this library.
